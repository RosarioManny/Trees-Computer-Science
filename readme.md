# Binary Trees and Tries Exercises

## Instructions

1. **Fork and Clone This Repository**

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Complete the Exercises**

   - **Part 1: Binary Trees and Tries Exercises**

      After completing the Binary Trees and Tries Lesson you can complete the exercises in `binary-tree.js`.

      > **Note:** The `height()` and `isBalanced()` functions should be considered an optional challenge that prepares you for the second lesson's challenges.

   - **Optional Trie Challenge**

      The "word-trie-challenge" folder contains an optional challenge asking you to implement a search trie based on all the words in the English language. This is **optional and advanced**, but if you mastered building a binary tree, you should take on this challenge!

      This nested project folder also contains automated tests that can be run in the same way.

   - **Part 2: Self-Balancing Binary Tree Exercise**

      After completing the Balancing a Binary Tree Lesson, you can complete the exercises in `AVLTree.js`.

      These exercises are also **optional and advanced content**.

4. **Check Your Work**

   There are test files for each of these exercises. Use these test files to check if your implementation is correct.
   To verify your solutions, run the test files by executing:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
